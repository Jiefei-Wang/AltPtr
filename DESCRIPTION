Title: An utility to create an ALTREP object with a virtual pointer
Version: 0.99.0
Authors@R: person("Jiefei", "Wang", email = "szwjf08@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
    Creates a virtual pointer for R's ALTREP object which does not 
    have the data allocates in memory. The pointer is made by the file 
    mapping of a virtual file so it behaves exactly the same as a regular
    pointer. All the requests to access the pointer will be sent to the 
    underlying file system and eventually handled by a customized 
    data-reading function.
