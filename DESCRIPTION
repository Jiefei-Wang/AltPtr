Description: Creating a virtual pointer for R's ALTREP object which does not have a pointer. 
    The pointer is made by the file mapping of a virtual file so 
    there is no real allocation of the data for the pointer.
    All the requests to access the pointer will be sent to the underlying file system
    and eventually handled by a customized data-reading function.
