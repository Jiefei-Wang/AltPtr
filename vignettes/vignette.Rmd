# Introduction
## ALTREP
ALTREP is a relatively new feature that has been released since R3.5. It stands for alternative representation of R's vector object. The main motivation is to reduce the memory load when creating some special vector. Consider the example
```{r}
x <- 1:(1024*1024*1024*1024)
length(x)
typeof(x)
```
You might think the above crazy code will exhaust all the memory in your machine and burn your computer into ash. However, if you are using any version of R that is equal or newer than 3.5, the code works like a charm. You can access the data of `x` as usual
```{r}
head(x)
```
You might have a guess on what has happened here. The data of the vector `x` clearly has a lot of redundance. Since it is an arithmetic sequence, you only need to know the first item and common difference to know every values in `x`. As long as you do not need the entire data at once, it would not consumes all of your memory. A minimum ALTREP object can be made by defining a length function and an element retrieving function at C level, the function prototypes are
```{}
R_xlen_t length(SEXP x);
double real_elt(SEXP x, R_xlen_t i);
```
We wouldn't go into details of the ALTREP but you can see how to use the above two functions to get the length and values from the vector `x`. If you are interested in making your own ALTREP, here are two great documents from the ancient time

1. [ALTREP and Other Things](https://www.r-project.org/dsc/2017/slides/dsc2017.pdf): A review of the structure of ALTREP
2. [ALTREP and C++](https://purrple.cat/blog/2018/10/14/altrep-and-cpp/): A tutorial of ALTREP with  examples. It helps me a lot when I first saw the idea of ALTREP

## Challenge with ALTREP
Although the idea of the ALTREP sounds exciting as it greatly extends the flexibility of R's vector, it also breaks the assumption that all R's vectors have a pointer associated with them. While today's R developers might be aware of it, there has been tons of packages developed before ALTREP and their work depends on this assumption. Before R3.5, It is very common to loop over the data of R's vector at C level like 
```
double my_sum(SEXP x){
  double* ptr = (double*)DATAPTR(x);
  double total = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < XLENGTH(x); ++i){
    total = total + ptr[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```
The above code works for a regular R vector since its data has been in the memory. However, for an ALTREP object, as it might not have a pointer, it only has two options when `DATAPTR` is called:

1. Allocating the data in memory and return the pointer that is requested.
2. Call `Rf_error` to throw an error message.

While the first one seems to be a good choice, it is actually not always feasible in practice for the object might be larger than the available memory(As the crazy vector example we saw previously). The second choice can be used if a pointer cannot be given, but it prevents the ALTREP object from being used by many old but useful packages. Also, it might causes memory leaking for the objects allocated in heap may not have a chance to release themselves. For an arithmetic sequence in the first example, it actually adopt both strategies: It will allocate the memory for a short sequence, but throw an error for a long sequence. For example
```{r}
## Short sequence
x1 <- 1:10
x1[1] <- 10 
head(x)

## long sequence 
x2 <- 1:(1024*1024*1024*1024)
tryCatch(
  {x2[1] <- 10 }, 
  error = function(e) message(e)
)
```
As of R4.1, every attempt to change the R vector will require to access the pointer of the vector. For a short sequence this can be easily solved via the memory allocation. However, for a large sequence, since there would not be enough space for a 8192Gb vector, doing so will end up with an error message. 
Requiring the pointer from an ALTREP object has been a very serious limitation that prevents it from being used in practice to represent a large data. Travel package can help to mitigate the problem.

## Travel package
Travel package is an utility for developers to build ALTREP objects with a virtual pointer. The pointer of the ALTREP object can be accessed via the regular `DATAPTR` function in `Rinternals.h` at C level. The basic workflow of using the package is

![](Making altrep.png)

The pointer is "virtual" in the sense that the data does not exist in the memory before one actually try to access the data. The pointer is made via File mapping, but it wouldn't consume any disk space neither for the file been mapped is also a virtual file. All the request to access the file will be sent to developer's provided callback function. Suppose we have made an ALTREP object with the data reading function `read_data`. Let the pointer of the ALTREP object be `ptr`. Here is what happens behind the scenes when you want to read the `i`th element of the pointer

![](data request.png)

As we see from the flowchart, the data of the pointer `ptr` is made on-demand. The pointer would not exhaust the memory even if it points to an extremely large object. By doing that we solve the main limitation of the ALTREP. The pointer of the ALTREP object can be accessed in a usual way, and the memory consumption is minimum. Take the crazy large vector as the example again, the package provide a wrapper function for turning an old ALTREP object into a new ALTREP object with a virtual pointer. 
```{r}
x <- 1:(1024*1024*1024*1024)
y <- wrap_altrep(x)

x[1:10]
y[1:10]
```
While `x` and `y` looks the same, the pointer of `y` can be accessed as usual
```{r}
## We only compute the sum of the first 10 elements
code <- 
'
  double* ptr = (double*)DATAPTR(x);
  double total = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){
    total = total + ptr[i];
    }
  return ScalarReal(total);
'
my_sum <- cxxfunction(signature(x="SEXP"),
                    body=code)

## An error will be given for x
tryCatch(
  my_sum(x), 
  error = function(e) message(e)
)
## No error will be given and the sum can be computed
my_sum(y)
```
Furthermore, the data of the vector `y` is mutable.
```{r}
y[1] <- -1
my_sum(y)
```
Please note that the wrapper function `wrap_altrep` should be used with caution for it will call R's function in a multithreaded environment. As R is known to be a single thread program, it is not recommended to use the function in practice. `wrap_altrep` should be called for demonstration purpose only. In the next section, we will show you how to formally build your own ALTREP object using Travel package.

# Travel tutorial
## Dependencies
There are a few dependencies you need to install for using the package.

For *Windows*:

1. [Dokan](https://dokan-dev.github.io/)

It is recommended to download `DokanSetup-noVC.exe` for this is the library that the Travel package has been tested with. 

For *Linux* and *Mac*:

1. [fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
2. [pkg-config]()

## Link against Travel library
To avoid calling any R function when accessing the ALTREP data, you must provide a C++ data reading function to the Travel package. Here is the tutorial on how to include the Travel C++ header and link against its static library.
### Step 1
For making the Travel header findable, you must add `Travel` to the `LinkingTo` field of the DESCRIPTION file, e.g.
```
LinkingTo: Travel
```
### Step 2
In C++ files, include the header of the Travel functions `#include "Travel/Travel.h"`.

### Step 3
To compile and link your package successfully against the `Travel` C++ library, you must include a `src/Makevars` file.
```
TRAVEL_OBJECT_LIBS = $(shell echo 'Travel:::pkgconfig("PKG_LIBS")'|\
                     "${R_HOME}/bin/R" --vanilla --slave)
TRAVEL_OBJECT_CPPFLAGS = $(shell echo 'Travel:::pkgconfig("PKG_CPPFLAGS")'|\
                         "${R_HOME}/bin/R" --vanilla --slave)
                         
PKG_LIBS := $(PKG_LIBS) $(TRAVEL_OBJECT_LIBS)
PKG_CPPFLAGS := $(PKG_CPPFLAGS) $(TRAVEL_OBJECT_CPPFLAGS)
```
Note that `$(shell ...)` is GNU make syntax so you should add GNU make to the SystemRequirements field of the DESCRIPTION file of your package, e.g.
```
SystemRequirements: GNU make
```
You can find short explanations of the Travel C++ APIs in `Travel/Travel.h`.

## Use Travel
The main function of the Travel package is `Travel_make_altptr`, its function declaration is as follows
```
SEXP Travel_make_altptr(int type, size_t length, file_data_func read_func, void *private_data,
                        SEXP protect = R_NilValue);
```
where `type` specifies the R's vector type defined in `Rinternals.h`(e.g. `LGLSXP`, `INTSXP` or `REALSXP`), `length` is the lenght of the vector. `read_func` is a function pointer that will eventually be called when the data of the altrep is required. `private_data` is a pointer for developers to store any data that is opaque to the Travel package. `protect` is used to make sure the source of the ALTREP(if any) has the same lifespan as the ALTREP itself.  

The function `read_func` is a core function to define an ALTREP object. Its prototype is 
```
size_t (*file_data_func)(filesystem_file_data &file_data, void *buffer, size_t offset, size_t length);
```
where `file_data` is a simple struct which contains your `private_data` pointer and many other member variables that are necessary for the Travel package. `buffer` is the memory buffer that will hold the requested data. `offset` is the index of the vector element that is requested, note that the offset is an 0-based index. Therefore, if `offset = 10` it means the `11`th element is requested. `length` is the number of the vector elements that is requested starting from `offset`. Each call to `read_func` will read a consecutive data in the vector. The final read result should be write back to `buffer` and the length of the read should be returned.

Besides the ALTREP creation function, the package also provides a smart pointer to ease the development of the ALTREP. The prototypes of the smart pointer are
```
template <typename T>
SEXP Travel_shared_ptr(T ptr, SEXP tag = R_NilValue, SEXP prot = R_NilValue);
template <typename T>
SEXP Travel_shared_ptr(T *ptr, SEXP tag = R_NilValue, SEXP prot = R_NilValue);
```
The return value of `Travel_shared_ptr` is an external pointer and the lifespan of the external pointer is controlled by R's Garbage collector. Once the external pointer is released, it will free the space that is occupied by the pointer `ptr`. Here is an example of using the smart pointer
```
SEXP extPtr = Travel_shared_ptr<int>(new int);
SEXP extPtrArray = Travel_shared_ptr<int[]>(new int[10]);
```
The smart pointer can be used to release your `private_data` when the ALTREP object is not in used and prevent it from memory leaking. Combining all these functions together, we can make a simple arithmetic sequence with any step value in R. Here are the code snippet for the example. The full example can be found at []() 
```
#include <Rcpp.h>
#include "Travel/Travel.h"
using namespace Rcpp;

struct Seq_info{
  size_t start;
  size_t step;
  ~Seq_info(){
    Rprintf("I am called from GC\n");
  }
};

size_t read_sequence(filesystem_file_data &file_data, void *buffer, size_t offset, size_t length)
{
  Seq_info* info = (Seq_info*)file_data.private_data;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++)
  {
    ((double *)buffer)[i] = info -> start + info -> step * (offset + i);
  }
  return length;
}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP make_sequence_altrep(size_t n, size_t start, size_t step)
{
  Seq_info* info = new Seq_info{start, step};
  SEXP smart_ptr = Rf_protect(Travel_shared_ptr<Seq_info>(info));
  SEXP x = Rf_protect(Travel_make_altptr(REALSXP, n, read_sequence, info, smart_ptr));
  Rf_unprotect(2);
  return x;
}
```
Here is the output from the example
```
> x <- make_sequence_altrep(n = 1024*1024*1024*64, start = 1, step = 2)
> length(x)
[1] 68719476736
> x[1:10]
 [1]  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19
> x[1] <- 100
> x[1:10]
 [1] 100   3   5   7   9  11  13  15  17  19
> 
> rm(x)
> gc()
I am called from GC
          used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb)
Ncells  819800 43.8    1487236 79.5  1487236 79.5
Vcells 1863208 14.3    8388608 64.0  2630899 20.1
```
Now you get a vector `x` with a crazy size, enjoy the full power of the ALTREP objects!
